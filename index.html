    <h3>Welcome to 'Bread & Cheeses'!</h3>
    <p>This website aims at sharing my experience on <a href='bread.md'>bread</a> and <a href='cheese.md'>cheese</a> making at home. Bread and cheese are two products from our everyday life that are the result of fermentation. This makes those products sometimes difficult to make at home. A same recipe may work differently depending on the temperature of your kitchen. Indeed, fermentation processes involve different parameters that are sometimes difficult to understand and to control. Mastering them often comes with years of practice and experiments.</p>
    <p>With this website I would like to share my own experience and describe my successes and failures. I wish that it can help others to take the plunge!</p>
