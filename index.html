    <!--<h3>Welcome to <b>Cheese in the City</b>, a website about making cheese in a small appartment!</h3>-->
    <p>This blog aims at sharing experience on <a href='/basics.md'>cheese</a> making at home. I will try not to use
        industrial cultures but rather use living cultures that are more diverse and natural.
        What sorts of cheese is it possible to make when living in an appartment? How to find good milk? How to rippen cheese in fridge?
        This blog is an ongoing work, aiming to answer all those sorts of questions with a scientific touch.</p>
