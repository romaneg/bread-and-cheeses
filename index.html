    <h3>Welcome to <b>Cheese in the City</b>, a website about making cheese in a small appartment!</h3>
    <p>This website aims at sharing my experience on <a href='/basics.md'>cheese</a> making at home. Cheese is a product we are used to buy from supermarket, groceries or local producers, but we rarely think about making some ourselves. It seems unfeasible. However it is not! That does not mean it is easy though. Dealing with fermentation is not something that can be learned only by reading books. A same recipe may work differently depending on the temperature of your kitchen, the humidity, the milk you are using etc. Indeed, fermentation processes involve different parameters that are sometimes difficult to understand and to control. Mastering them often comes with years of practice and experiments.</p>
    <p>With this website I would like to share <a href='/logbook.md'>my own trials</a> at making cheese in a small appartment in Boston (MA, USA). I wish that it can help others to take the plunge!</p>
