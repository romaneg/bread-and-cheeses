#### *The art of natural cheesemaking*, David Asher, Chelsea Green Publishing

My very first book on cheesemaking, offered by my best friend in 2018. My adventure with cheesemaking started with this book. It helped me discover traditional cheesemaking from natural ingredients. It is a true goldmine for those who want to get rid of industrial ferments. It gives the bases and multiple recipes (goat cheese, camembert, blue cheese, St-Marcellin etc.).

#### *Artisan cheese making at home*, Mary Karlin, 10 speed press

To the best of my knowledge, this is the first book that ever talked about how to make cheese at home. This book is a very good resource about milk, fermentation, material, techniques. It also gives a lot of different recipes, classified by level of difficulty. The recipes are adapted to small quantities of milk (2l to 4L), which makes it ideal when starting cheesemaking at home.
