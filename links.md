Many many videos with step-by-step cheese making recipes, cheese degustations. Very funny guy (probably the Australian sense of humour!). 
Wonderful ressource, tips, visual examples. (recipes with pasteurized milk, additives and industrial cultures/molds though...)

**[La laiterie de Paris](http://lalaiteriedeparis.blogspot.com/) (the parisian dairy)**

Pierre was farming goats in the west of France. After a trip around the world to discover different cheesemakers, he decided
to start a urban dairy in Paris.
I could not taste his cheeses yet, but I can assure you that his instagram accound shows amazing cheeses!
Yogurts, cream, goat cheeses, haloumi etc. The pictures are amazing.
His blog (in French, sorry...) gives several homemade cheese recipes as well as reports on cheesemakes and many other
information about cheese.
If you go to Paris, come by and taste his production:  **74 Rue des Poissonniers, 75018 Paris, France**.
