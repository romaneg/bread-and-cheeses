My name is Romane, I am a French researcher working in computer science applied to medical imaging. I have been living in the US for a few years. 
When I am not in front of my computer screen, running new machine learning experiments, I like to cook real things! I have been doing pastry cooking for many years now. Years after years I have developed some interest for fermentation processes. Dealing with living matter is fun and full of surprises. I cook my own sourdough bread every week. I also love cooking croissants and brioches of course.

Recently, I started to make my own cheese at home and without indrustrial ferments. I discovered a new fascinating world. With only one material (milk) and few parameters (temperature, humidity, time), you can end up with so many different results! Also, it is a lot easier than we could think.
