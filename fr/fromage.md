### Why making cheese is an art?

The variety of cheeses is huge (France on its own counts more than 1,200 different types of cheeses!). It is impressive as only one product can transform to so many different forms. 
Cheese development depends on multiple parameters:
- milk quality
- ferments (type and diversity of bacterias, yeast)
- *terroir* (French word designating the local environment)
- temperature
- humidity
