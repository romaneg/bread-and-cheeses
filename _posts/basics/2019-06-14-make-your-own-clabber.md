*Fermented milk at room temperature turns into clabber, an easy-to-use starter for cheesemaking*

<!--excerpt.start-->
To make cheese you basically need [milk]({{site.baseurl}}/2019/03/02/raw-milk.html), micro-organisms and [rennet]({{site.baseurl}}/basics.html).
To make flavorful and reproducible cheeses you need [*starter cultures*](({{site.baseurl}}/2019/05/22/starter-culture.html)), the same way you need *yeast*, *levain* or sourdough starter to make good bread.
A starter culture is basically a culture of ferments that will provide the right organisms to your milk for cheesemaking.
<!--excerpt.end-->
To understand what is a starter culture, you can read this [very detailed article]({{site.baseurl}}/2019/05/22/starter-culture.html) that I wrote earlier.

### From raw milk to clabber

To make your clabber you can either get some from a friend or make your own if you have access to raw milk.
It is worth mentionning that you can only make clabber from raw milk.

Get some raw milk and leave it at room temperature about 2 days (after milking).
The clabber is ready when the milk has coagulated (see picture above). The milk forms a sort of jelly. It tastes a bit like yogourt, a little acidic.

If it does not succeed, maybe the milk you used was kept too long at cold temperature or the milk has some problem.
Try again. You can also try to make it from different sources and keep the one which taste you prefer (micro-organisms can be different depending on multiple factors).


### Keep your clabber alive

Once your clabber is ready you just need to feed it with fresh milk.
Every day, take a small amount of clabber and add some milk (in the proportions 1:50, roughly).
You can feed it every two or three days but feeding it every day makes your culture more active. The more active, the better for cheesemaking.
Taste it from time to time, thus you will know how it evolves and you will know how it should taste for your cheeses.

If you need to go on vacation, you can freeze your clabber as ice cubes. To revive your clabber, take an ice cube and add new fresh milk. Feed it every day again.
It will take a few days so that your clabber reaches its former activity.
