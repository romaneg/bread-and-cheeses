<!--excerpt.start-->
When people ask me what I am missing from France in terms of food I am generally embarassed. I do not miss so much things (of course I am missing buying a good butter croissant on my way to work but I can deal with it!). Moreover if I cannot find a product I like I generally bake it myself. I love baking bread, brioches, croissants...

But one day I really liked eating *aligot*. Aligot is a dish from the center of France (Aubrac region). Mashed potato is cooked with tomme fraiche (a lot of tomme fraiche! ... and butter) and looks a bit like fondue. I is simply delicious! But where could I find *tomme fraiche* in Boston?

That's how I decided to make it myself!

### Ingredients

- 4L of [milk]({{site.baseurl}}/2019/03/02/raw-milk.html)
- 30ml of kefir
- 1/4 to 1/2 tablets of Walcoren rennet, crushed and diluted in about 30ml of cold water wihtout chlorine (to decrease the chlorine contained in tap water just shake it and leave it rest for a while)

### Material

- a big pan with a thick bottom (to keep the milk warm)
- a way of warming up the pan and keep a constant temperature (ring with diffuser, or a big basin of warm water)
- thermometer
- a whisk to cut the curd in very small pieces
- cheese cloth or equivalent and strainer
- cheese mold

### Duration

3-4h until draining, then 10h to 24h for further draining and drying

### Method

Timings are subject to change depending on your material and the quality of your ingredients.
Take care of using well-cleaned material (use white vinegar, rinse with clear water and keep it dry in the open air). Wash your hands too!

Tomme is a typical cooked and pressed cheese from mountain regions. This type of cheese is ripened several months or years (at least 6 months). As such, it follows a process that allows to remove the most water as possible: 1) by cutting the curd in very small pieces, 2) by pressing the curd. To make *tomme fraiche* you only need to do the whole steps before salting the cheese. If you want to ripen this cheese you will have to salt it and then leave it in a cheese cave at around 5°C for months, you may also have to wash the rind with brine depending on recipes.

**Time : 00:00**

Pour the milk in the pan and let it warm up very gently until it reaches 32°C.
If you use a gaz ring with a diffuser, take into account the intertia of the diffuser. 

**Time : 00:30, Temperature : 32°C**

Add the starter or the kefir.
Stir together from bottom to top and for at least 2 minutes.
Leave it ferment for about 1h. Keep the temperature to 32°C. You can put a lid on the pan to keep it warm.

**Time : 01:30, Temperature : 32°C**

The milk has started to ferment. You can now add the rennet. Pour gently and for at least 2 minutes so that it is well homogenized. Try not moving the pan after that step, so that the milk coagulates well.

The rennet will allow the milk to coagulate rapidly (more rapidly than how the milk would naturally). Given the milk quantity, its freshness and the amount of rennet, the milk is going to coagulate more or less rapidly. Try to always use the same milk to increase the chance of reproductibility and to know the best dosage of rennet. With pasteurized milk I generally use 1/4 tablet of Walcoren for 2L of milk . It is more than the recommendations of the manufacturer but I noticed that the curd was firmer with this quantity.


**Time : 02:00 - 03:00, Temperature: 32°C**

The milk has now started to coagulate. If you move a little the pan you should see it shaking slightly like a *panna cotta*. Check that the curd is ready with the following test: put your finger in the curd with an angle of 45 degrees and go up to cut the curd. If the cut is clearthen the curd is ready. Otherwise wait for another 10-15 minutes and do the test again.


**Time : 2:10 - 3:10, Temperature : 32°C**

It is now time to cut the curd. Use the whisk to reduce the curd to very small pieces of the size of lentils (see picture below).

*Curd cut, warmed up and strained*

**Time: 2:20 - 3:20, Temperature 32°C -> 40°C**

Now warm up the curd very slowly (about 1°C every minute), while stiring so that the curd does not fall on the bottom of the pan. Once it reaches 40°C, leave it rest at least 10min. The curd should fall on the bottom and you should be able to remove the whey easily.

**Time : 2:40 - 3:40**

Prepare a strainer with a cheese cloth. Remove as much whey as possible and then pour the curd in the strainer. Use your hand to mix it and press it. Leave it drain for a while.
Now put the curd with the cheese cloth into the cheese mold to continue draining. Press with your hands to give it the shape of the mold.


**Time : 3:00 - 4:00, Room temperature (~20°C)**

Now add some load on the cheese to enforce draining. I use for instance a bottle of milk in which I can add water little by little. Increase the load and return the cheese several times. Then let it drain for the night at room temperature.

*Curd pressing and final result*

**Time : ~10:00, Room temperature (~20°C)**

If your cheese does not drip anymore and it feels dry and firm, your are done!
Otherwise you should let it dry again, continue pressing and draining for a few hours.
Once it is ready you can keep it warped in the fridge. Use rapidly for your aligot!
