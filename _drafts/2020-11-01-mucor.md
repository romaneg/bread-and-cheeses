### What is mucor?

fungus
like felt, white in the begninning, very thin and small filaments with smal grey dots at the end, that then transforms in grey then black 'hair' [<sup>1</sup>](#1)
'cat fur', 'cat hair'

Researchers from Tufts University have discovered that the filaments of mucor forms networks that are used by bacteria to move along and disperse[<sup>3</sup>](#3). [video](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-017-02522-z/MediaObjects/41467_2017_2522_MOESM6_ESM.mov)

### What to do?

 Cheese ripening guide [<sup>1</sup>](#1): 
 - appears very rapidly in the ripening process (after 2-4 days)
 - compete against penicillium and prevent it to grow
 - gives bitter taste to the cheese
 - causes: 
    - the room is infected + too much humidity in the cheese
                           + too much salt or few salt (other microrganisms cannot spread)
                           + temperature is too low in the first days of drying

 - remedies:
    - the room is infected => disinfect it
    - salting is not appropriate => increase it if you want to favor Penicillium, or decrease it to favor Geotrichum
    - acidification is too high => drain more, increase the temperature of the room


David Asher recommends to salt more the cheese[<sup>1</sup>](#1), this will favor Penicillium
