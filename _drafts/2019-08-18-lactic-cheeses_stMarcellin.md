![crottin from cow raw milk]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cheese/2019-08/2019-06-09_crottin-bread-homemade.JPG)
*Crottin-style cheese made for raw cow milk and natural ferments. Beautiful with bread!*

<!--excerpt.start-->



<!--excerpt.end-->

### Ingredients  - 4-5 small cheeses

- 4L of [milk]({{site.baseurl}}/2019/03/02/raw-milk.html), preferably the freshest raw milk
- 30ml of kefir, or 30ml of clabber or other cheese culture
- 1/2 tablet of Walcoren rennet, crushed and diluted in about 30ml of cold water wihtout chlorine (to decrease the chlorine contained in tap water just shake it and leave it rest for a while)
- 10g of fine-grained salt (preferably sea salt, and without any additive)

### Material

- a big pot, marmite
- a laddle
- cheese molds
- grid and platter for draining the curd and receive the whey

#### For ripening
- boxes with lid
- sushi mats or wooden boards or other placti mats
- surface to leave the cheese on (leaf, brak, ... be creative!), otherwise it may be difficult to move and leak...

[More details]({{site.baseurl}}/2019/03/04/starter-kit.html) about material.

### Duration

- ~24h to ferment and curd
- ~24h to drain in molds
- ~24h to drain after salting
- 3-6 weeks for ripening (depending on your taste and patience!)

### Method

Timings are subject to change depending on your material, the quality of your ingredients, the temperature and humidity.
Take care of using well-cleaned material (use white vinegar, rinse with clear water and keep it dry in the open air). Wash your hands too!

**0h, Temperature : ~30째C to room temperature**

Pour the milk in the pot and let it warm up very gently until it reaches ~30째C.
Add the ferments and the rennet. Stirr well from bottom to top. 
Let stand at room temperature and forget about it for about 24h (try not to move it, in order not to break the curd).
If your room temperature is above 26-28째C, you may have to let it ferment less longer (~14-16h is probably enough).

**~+24h, Temperature : room temperature**

The curd should have sunk at the bottom of the pot, covered by whey. 
The whey should be covered by a very fine layer of white yeast (this is Geotrichum Candidum, responsible for many cheese rinds).
It is time to mold the cheeses. Saint-Marcellin, crottin, pick your favorite shape!
Prepare 4-5 cheese molds, that you can put on a pastry grid over a platter (to receive the whey).
Then laddle the curd in the molds. Fill the molds, wait for a while and fill them again. 
You are going to be amazed by how much whey is going to drain. You can press a little bit the top to make it flat but it is not mandatory.
Cover with a linen or a cheesecloth, to avoid flies to settle in. Let it drain.

**~+28h, Temperature : room temperature**

The curd should have drained enough so that you can flip the cheeses in their molds. 
Let the cheese slide from the mold to your hand, flip it and put the mold on top and flip the mold.
Be very careful, the cheeses are still fragile. 
If you went to bed after moulding, no worries, this step can wait.
You can flip the cheeses a few times in their molds for the next 24h. This will make the shape more unfirorm and drain water more homogeneously.

**~+48h, Temperature: room temperature**

The cheeses should now be well shaped, still humid. It is time to salt them. 
Salt will slow down the rind ripening, help extract more whey and will also give better flavor to the cheese.
Measure 10g of salt and use it to salt all the cheeses. Take the cheeses in one hand, dust a bit of salt on the first face, spread with the fingers. 
Do the same on the sides and on the other face. Put the cheese back in the mold (if your kitchen is dry) or directly on a grid or sushi mat.
Let the cheeses dry for another 12-24h (depending on your room temperature).

**+60-72h, Temperature : room temperature**

The cheeses should start developing a very thin yeasty layer on top. That's very good sign! They start ripening!
It is time now to slow down the fermentation and put them into a cheese cave or a colder environment.
I usually set my cheese cave (a small wine cooler) to about 14-16째C.
I put the cheeses on sushi mats in plactic boxes and take care of raising the mats with whater I can find (jar lids, wood sticks etc.). 
Otherwise, the water released by the cheeses may stay in contact with the rind and the cheeses would not age properly.
I put a lid on the plastic box but leave it slightly open so that some humidity can evacuate.
