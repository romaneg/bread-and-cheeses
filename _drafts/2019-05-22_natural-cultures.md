*Micelle on the microscope (Hristov et al., 2015)*

<!--excerpt.start-->
To make cheese you basically need [milk]({{site.baseurl}}/2019/03/02/raw-milk.html), micro-organisms and [rennet]({{site.baseurl}}/basics.html).
To make flavorful and reproducible cheeses you need *starter cultures*, the same way you need *levain* or sourdough starter to make good bread.
<!--excerpt.end-->

If you are already a bit familiar with cheese making, you probably have already encountered cheese recipes involving adding *mesophilic culture*, *thermophilic culture*, *bacteria linens* etc.
These cultures can be bought at cheesemaking supplies, and they are not cheap! You will have to spend about $3 for 3L of milk.
One package of mesophilic cultures usually contain one to three different micro-organisms. 
Those specific micro-organisms have been selected and cultivated by industrial processes to be very resistant to lyophilisation and to be rehydrated very quickly.
In particular, they have been created to re-populate pasteurized milk with cheese specific micro-organisms (pasteurization kills all micro-organisms of the milk).

These industrial cultures are now widely used in the dairy industries and farms. 
But how were the cheese makers doing before those cultures were commercialized?
